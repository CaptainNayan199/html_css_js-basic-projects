Welcome to my `HTML CSS JS Basic Projects` repository. This repository contains various projects that I have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects are perfect for beginners who are learning web development and want to get some hands-on experience. Iam also new to this field, learning from my own, practicing daily(if possible). 

# Projects 🧑‍💻
Here are the projects included in this repository:

Project 1: `Create a Simple Add/Sub/Mul/Div operation` <br><br>

# Getting Started 👌
 
To get started with these projects, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are new to web development, I recommend checking out some online tutorials to get started.

To view the projects, simply open the corresponding HTML file in your web browser. For projects that include JavaScript, you can open the JavaScript file to view the code.
